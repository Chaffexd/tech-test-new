# The Contentful Tech Challenge

This challenge composes content for our fictional drinks menu, it looks like it's broken at the moment so we need to fix it. There are 6-8 challenges that focus on a few key areas of JavaScript and Contentful.

The idea of the challenge isn't to stump you in any way but purely to see how you would troubleshoot an issue live. I hope you enjoy the challenge and we can look at fixing our drinks menu together!
